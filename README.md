## Matrix Type 3


</div>

### Description

For those of you that have checked out my other attempt at Matrix style text, this is the new version 3. The code has been optimized, while still not using any API calls or advanced functions. I'm trying to push the speed of the algorithm as much as I can using only "core" VB code. If anyone has any suggestions on how to make it any faster, please leave a comment! And don't forget to vote if you like what you see!
